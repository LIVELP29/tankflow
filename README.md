# tankflow
Our assignment from [@blaubacher](https://github.com/blaubacher):
Using Tank=10m Diam, Water initial height (40 m), orifice @ bottom = 1.0 m diam, Specific Gravity of water =1.0
Determine:  Tank Water level, flow rate (kg/s), Water jet velocity.
How long does it take to drain the tank down to 5 m ?

Answer: 184.5sec to reach 5m for 1000 iterations over 500sec
to be compared to total time to empty the tank, supposed to be (D^2/d^2)*sqrt(2.h/g) = 285sec

the output.txt file shows z=0m at 275sec
